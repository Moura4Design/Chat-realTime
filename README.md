# Chat-realTime
Project Overview:
This project was developed during my studies at New York Code + Academy as the final project of the course. It features a real-time chat system alongside a small website, created using a Node.js application with several key functionalities: static page services, form submission handling with CAPTCHA verification, storing feedback in a SQLite database, and enabling real-time communication via WebSockets.

Technologies Used in Node.js:
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable applications.
Express: Web framework for handling HTTP routes and middleware.
Socket.IO: Enables real-time, two-way communication between the client and server.
SQLite: Lightweight SQL database used to store visitor feedback.
Body-Parser: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies.
Google reCAPTCHA: Protects the feedback form from bot submissions.
Request: A library used to make HTTP calls to verify reCAPTCHA (now deprecated, but used here for simplicity).

Front-End Technologies:
HTML: Used to structure the website pages and forms, and includes a slide show feature.
CSS: Provides the styling and layout for the pages.
JavaScript: Implements a basic image slideshow with "Previous" and "Next" navigation buttons. It also includes clickable indicators (dots) that allow users to jump to specific slides.
